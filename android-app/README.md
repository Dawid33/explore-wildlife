# Android App

## Running Locally

Create a file called `local.properties` with the following content:

```
sdk.dir=<path>
```

Replace `<path>` with the path to your SDK.


AndroidManifest.xml contains the string "YOUR_API_KEY".
This string should be replaced with a Google Maps API key for location functionality to work.
